# Since Google Code is closing down soon, all versions of this project will now be available solely via Sourceforge: #

## http://sourceforge.net/projects/vector-cards/ ##

# Version 2.0 has now been released at the sourceforge page. #


These poker sized cards have been created and hand optimized in various vector formats (.eps and .svg) using the open source .svg graphics editor **Inkscape** http://www.inkscape.org.

The vector images have been tested to work with Inkscape and Adobe Illustrator CS5.
